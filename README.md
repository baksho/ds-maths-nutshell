# Description
This repository contains fundamental concepts of different branches of mathematics and stochastics, which are cornerstones for a successful career in machine learning and data science.
More specifically, this repository contains concepts from different areas of functional analysis, linear algebra, stochastics etc.

> **Note**: The chapters are divided based on my understanding and in a sequence which I found easier to comprehend one-by-one. The repository as a whole is still <u>*work in progress*</u> and many of the files are, as of now, placeholders, only to be updated later. This gives an idea which area I will be updating the next. I am taking some time out from my daily schedule and contributing to this repository. Since, I cannot afford to spend a lot of time on a regular basis, the completion may take some time. Meanwhile, I ask whoever is visiting this repository to have a little patience. And I do appreciate anyone willing to collaborate.

## Content
Currently I am working on the **functional analysis** part of this repositiry.
.doc files are stored in the [docs](/docs/) folder and .pdf files are stored in the [pdfs](/pdfs/) folder.
1. **01_Vector Space**: Concepts of a vector space, basis, span and linear independence.

**Further topics**:
- [] Inner Products and Norms
- [] Metrics
- [] Linear Mappings
- [] Affine Spaces
- [] Sequences, Limits, Open and Closed Sets
- [] Cauchy Sequences and Complete Spaces
- [] Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality
- [] Banach Spaces
- [] Hilbert Spaces
- [] Orthogonality
- [] Continuity
- [] Operator Norm
